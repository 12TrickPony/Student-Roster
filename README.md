# Student-Roster
School project written in C++ || Visual Studio 2019
This is for the "Night Owls" out there that need a bit of help understanding the structure of the code required for this project. Take what you need to learn from this repo, but please DO NOT simply copy my code. You WILL get caught if you do that, so learn what you need to learn, and make the project your own. Remember, there are multiple ways to obtain the same level of output here. Your code will likely be very similar to other examples you find out there, but it doesn't have to directly match up to anyone else's in order for it to work. 

You've worked hard and are likely in a ton of debt to be where you are. Don't waste it by getting kicked out of school for submitting someone else's work. 
Keep your chin up! You'll do just fine.. ;)
